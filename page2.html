            <h3>Tesla Model 3</h3>
            <p>Above is a picture of a 2020 Tesla Model 3 Performance. The Tesla Model 3 is one of the best (and most
                affordable) electric cars on the market in 2021. Currently, the Model 3 is the best selling electric car
                <strong>ever</strong> with more than 500,000 units sold worldwide since its initial release in 2017.

            <h3>Tesla Model Y</h3>
            <p>The Tesla Model Y is a very similar vehicle to the Model 3, however in the form of an SUV. In fact, more
                than 80%
                of Model Y components are shared with the Model 3. The Model Y has sold 124,000 units in around 1 year.
                The main
                differances between the 2 vehicles, is the amount of ground clearence as well as the inclusion of a
                power
                liftgate on the Model Y. Both vehicles aim to be significantly more affordable than Tesla's older cars.

            <h3>Chevrolet Bolt</h3>
            <p>Above is a 2020 Chevrolet Bolt. This vehicle starts at around $32,000.00 USD, and is meant to compete
                with the
                Tesla Model 3. Although its range is close to the Model 3's base range of 300 est. miles, they Bolt has
                recieved
                lower ratings from publications such as <a
                    href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/chevrolet/bolt/">Consumer
                    Reports</a> due to the lesser build quality as well as features.</p>
